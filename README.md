Nostalgic Kids Website for older computers

Thank you for your visit to OKids. This is website, which allows you to do flash activities within a 90s computer.

How to use website:

https://thegamesystems.github.io/OKids-Java/

You need flash to access the website. Or you can use the Java url.

**I, here at OKids, need YOUR help. I am out of ideas for what to add to OKids. I am currently making a form that lets you submit ideas for what to add. I am considering creating original OKids content using Scratch. Fingers-crossed that actually happens.**

Changlog:

Fixing issue where in "Pipe Mania", links above the game lead to non-existant beta site.

Scratch for OKids is in development!

**NOTICE: My school has flagged both okids.xyz, and thegamesystems.github.io. Thanks to this, I can no longer develop the site during school, as I need those to see the changes. Thanks to this, updates may be delayed. Sorry for the inconvience, but my school SUCKS**

Mission statement: This website's purpose is for preservation and gaming. If you want something removed, please email me at "thegamesystems@gmail.com". Flash content is provided by the FlashPoint archive and similar services. OKids is fully open-sourced, created purly for the purpose of entertainment, keeping old computers alive, and allowing future generations to enjoy legacy Flash content :D
