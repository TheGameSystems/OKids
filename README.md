**I, here at OKids, need YOUR help. I am out of ideas for what to add to OKids. I am currently making a form that lets you submit ideas for what to add. I am considering creating original OKids content using Scratch. Fingers-crossed that actually happens.**

**Happy Holidays from OKids**

Added OKids branding to Duck Life. More games to come

**NOTICE: My school has flagged both okids.xyz, and thegamesystems.github.io. Thanks to this, I can no longer develop the site during school, as I need those to see the changes. Thanks to this, updates may be delayed. Sorry for the inconvience, but my school SUCKS**

Mission statement: This website's purpose is for preservation and gaming. If you want something removed, please email me at "thegamesystems@gmail.com".
