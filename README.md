# OKids
Nostalgic Kids Website for older computers

Thank you for your visit to OKids. This is website, which allows you to do flash activities within a 90s computer.

How to use website:

Click the URL here or on the github side bar

http://okids.xyz
Or
https://thegamesystems.github.io/OKids-Java/

You need flash to access the website. Or you can use the Java url.

Changlog:

okids.xyz Java has been removed until further notice

Trying to resolve issue with background not showing

BONUS: if you type "okids.xyz/index.htm", you will see the conceptualized prototype of OKids homepage (which at the time was called ProtoKids)

**NOTICE: My school has flagged both okids.xyz, and thegamesystems.github.io. Thanks to this, I can no longer develop the site during school, as I need those to see the changes. Thanks to this, updates may be delayed. Sorry for the inconvience, but my school SUCKS**
