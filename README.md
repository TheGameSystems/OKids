# OKids
Nostalgic Kids Website for older computers

# OKids Website files will be moved to this repository on September 13, 2025 at or around 3:45pm. This means the website URL will be changed. The new URL will be "http://thegamesystems.github.io/OKids". We are sorry for the inconvienence, but we feel this will ease access and development for OKids. There will be a flash video shown on the OKids website with more information. The website will stay up until the repository is archived on November 27th, 2025. We can celebrate that OKids is no longer a concept, it is now a full-on project I am creating. Remember to join our Discord for updates to OKids. Thank you for taking the time to read this. If you would like, you can update bookmarks to accommodate this change. After two months of being a concept, OKids is finally coming true!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -TGS (developer of OKids)
